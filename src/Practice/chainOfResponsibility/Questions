An e-commerce system processes an order through multiple stages before shipping:
Inventory Check
If items are out of stock → stop processing
Payment Verification
If payment fails → stop processing
Fraud Detection
If flagged → stop processing
Packaging & Shipping (Only if all previous steps pass)

Each step:
Decides whether it can process
Either handles and passes forward
Or rejects and stops the chain
