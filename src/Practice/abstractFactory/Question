Question 1:

An enterprise application must support multiple databases such as:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

For each database, the system needs to create:
- Connection
- Statement

Constraints:
- All objects used together must belong to the same database family
- The application should be able to switch databases at runtime
- Client code should not depend on concrete database classes


// abstract product -> connection , statement
// concrete product -> MySqlConnection, PostgresConnection || MysqlStatement, PostgresStatement
// abstract factory -> DatabaseFactory
// concrete factory -> MYSQLFactory, PostgresFactory


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Question 2 :

You are building a system that supports multiple cloud providers:
    AWS
    Azure

For each cloud provider, the system must create:
    StorageService
    ComputeService

Constraints:
    Services must belong to the same cloud provider
    Switching cloud providers should not change client code
    Client must not directly create cloud-specific classes
