Scenario-Based Question (Decorator Pattern – File Encryption)

You are building a file storage system.

The system initially supports:
    Basic file saving

Over time, new features must be added:
    Encryption
    Compression
    Logging

Requirements:
    Features should be added dynamically at runtime
    Any combination of features should be possible
    (e.g., Encryption + Compression, Compression + Logging, all three)

Constraints:
Avoid creating many subclasses for every feature combination
Existing file-saving code should not be modified
