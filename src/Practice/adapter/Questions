You are developing a payment application that works with a standard interface:
PaymentProcessor → pay(amount)

The application already supports:
Credit Card payments
Debit Card payments

Now, a third-party UPI payment gateway needs to be integrated.
Problem:
The UPI library is already written and cannot be modified
It exposes a different method:
makePayment(value)

Requirements:
The existing system should continue using pay(amount)
The third-party UPI code must be reused without changing it
Client code should remain unchanged
