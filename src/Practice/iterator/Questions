You are building a library management system.
A Library stores books in different ways:
    Array
    List
    Stack

Clients want to traverse books one by one.f
The client should not know how books are stored internally.
Traversal logic should be consistent and reusable.

If the client directly accesses the collection:
Tight coupling
Change in data structure breaks client code
